Given the provided text, which lacks actual screenshots, I will create a hypothetical list of 10 UI elements based on the described action plan and potential dashboard elements.  Real positions and links would depend on the actual UI design.

**List of 10 UI Elements:**

1. **Element:** Response Time Graph (Screenshot 1 equivalent).  **Position:** Main dashboard area.  **Actionable Element:**  Interactive graph allowing zooming and filtering by time period.  **Data:** Shows response time trends over time.

2. **Element:** Response Time Breakdown Pie Chart (Screenshot 2 equivalent). **Position:**  Dashboard, potentially beside the graph.  **Actionable Element:**  Clickable slices to drill down into specific components (model inference, pre-processing). **Data:** Shows percentage breakdown of response time.

3. **Element:**  "Quantization" Button/Link.  **Position:** "Phase 1: Optimize Model Inference" section.  **Actionable Element:**  Navigates to documentation on quantization techniques or launches the quantization implementation tool. **Link:**  (Hypothetical) `/docs/quantization`

4. **Element:** "GPU Acceleration" Button/Link. **Position:** "Phase 1: Optimize Model Inference" section.  **Actionable Element:**  Opens a GPU configuration/benchmarking tool or documentation. **Link:** (Hypothetical) `/gpu-acceleration`

5. **Element:** "Model Profiling" Button/Link.  **Position:** "Phase 1: Optimize Model Inference" section.  **Actionable Element:**  Launches the model profiling tool. **Link:** (Hypothetical) `/model-profiler`

6. **Element:** "Caching Strategy Selection Dropdown". **Position:** "Phase 2: Optimize Data Pre-processing" section.  **Actionable Element:** Allows selecting from various caching strategies (LRU, FIFO, etc.).  **Options:** LRU, FIFO, etc.

7. **Element:** "Parallel Processing Configuration Panel".  **Position:** "Phase 2: Optimize Data Pre-processing" section.  **Actionable Element:**  Allows configuring the number of threads/processes for parallel processing.  **Data:** Number of cores, threads.

8. **Element:** "Compression Algorithm Selection Dropdown".  **Position:** "Phase 2: Optimize Data Pre-processing" section.  **Actionable Element:**  Allows choosing compression algorithms (gzip, zstd, etc.).  **Options:** gzip, zstd, etc.

9. **Element:** Progress Bar (Screenshot 3 equivalent).  **Position:** Top of dashboard.  **Actionable Element:** Visually represents progress towards the 20% reduction goal.  **Data:** Percentage completion of goal.

10. **Element:** "Contingency Plan" Button/Link.  **Position:** Bottom of dashboard or separate section.  **Actionable Element:**  Opens a detailed contingency plan document.  **Link:** (Hypothetical) `/contingency-plan`


Note:  The positions are relative and illustrative; actual positions would depend on the UI design.  The links are entirely hypothetical examples.  The actionable elements describe the user interaction with each UI element.
